# Quantum Bookstore 

A comprehensive bookstore management system built in Java that demonstrates all SOLID principles and good Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns. This project showcases a clean, maintainable, and extensible architecture for handling different types of books, inventory management, and purchase operations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Type Book Management**: Support for Paper Books, E-Books, and Showcase Books
- **Inventory Management**: Add books, remove outdated books, and track stock levels
- **Purchase System**: Complete buying process with stock validation and delivery
- **Delivery Services**: Automated shipping for paper books and email delivery for e-books
- **Stock Control**: Real-time inventory updates and availability checking
- **Outdated Book Removal**: Automatic identification and removal of old books

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- `Book`: Manages book data and basic operations
- `BookstoreInventory`: Handles inventory management operations
- `ShippingService`: Manages physical shipping operations
- `MailService`: Handles email delivery operations

#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- New book types can be added without modifying existing code
- New delivery methods can be implemented without changing core logic
- Payment systems can be extended without altering base classes

#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All book subtypes can be used interchangeably where `Book` is expected
- `Purchasable` implementations can be substituted without breaking functionality

#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- `Purchasable`: For books that can be bought
- `Shippable`: For books requiring physical shipping
- `Emailable`: For books that can be sent via email
- `Deliverable`: For books that can be delivered

#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- `BookstoreInventory` depends on `Purchasable` and `Deliverable` interfaces, not concrete implementations
